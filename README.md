Kastle Automation
=========
Scripts for automating Krieger's Kastle telnet game.

- Krieger Kastle.xlsx is the map of the game
- link to map: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TuqVXwYYit-Qv8WSQls64TOblJMtHQWOyFp-t5aMVMw/edit#gid=0
- kastle_wood_device.py navigates a Krieger clone to location 25 on the map and
uses the wooden device to open the door at location 26
- kastle_38, kastle_40, and kastle_42 each puts a krieger clone at the specified
file number location. These locations are where the three consoles are that have
the button that needs to be pushed at the same time to unlock the murderous 
octopus
- The kastle script has the krieger clone go around and collect everything on 
the map
